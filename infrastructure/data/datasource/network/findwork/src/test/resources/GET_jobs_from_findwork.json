It includes a no-strings-attached $15,000 dollar hiring bonus on your first paycheck. We are confident you’ll love working at Defiant and being a part of our amazing team, and our signing bonus reflects that.</div><div><br>At Defiant, we have broken down the traditional wall that exists between Dev and QA. Our QA team is more technical than most and spends time not just finding, reproducing, and logging bugs, but actually diagnosing the underlying cause and providing an unusual amount of detail to our dev team to help them quickly implement a fix.</div><div><br>For this role, you need to be able to read and write PHP and Javascript code along with SQL. Our hiring process will include a technical portion that will evaluate your ability to not only find and report bugs but to determine what the underlying cause of a bug is.</div><div><br>If you are currently in a QA role that is not as technical as you’d like, and you want to get your hands dirty looking at PHP and JS code, tracing execution, diving into the database, and diagnosing the underlying cause of an issue, then this role may be perfect for you.</div><div><br>Much like the DevOps role broke down the wall between the operations team and the development team, we have broken down the wall between QA and Dev by creating a role that we are calling “QADev”.</div><div><br>This job is 100% remote. You can work from anywhere as long as you have bandwidth. We do most of our calls voice only, and we also use push-to-talk so you can operate in noisy environments like a coffee shop, while traveling, or with kids around.</div><div><br>We are looking for individuals who don’t just do the minimum. Our team tries harder, goes further, digs deeper, pushes technology beyond its customary boundaries. WordPress powers 40% of the web, and we are the leaders in WordPress security. Compromise or complacency is not an option for us.</div><div><br>Our core hours are from 10am – 1pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. In general, we want our team to be available during that time, but we’re a realistic company, we understand that life happens, and we’re outcome-focused. So as long as you’re doing a great job and getting things done, we are flexible.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Requirements</strong></div><div>At Defiant we have one core value, and that is “Trust”. We trust that you’ll do a great job working remotely, be available during our core hours, and once you run out of work, find other ways to contribute.

We're a small development team of eight (six men, two women), in a company of 30, and we typically only hire twice a year.</div><div><br>Every person on the dev team has an outsized impact on the product—each feature is often the product of a pair of developers working together with a designer—and you can be one of them.</div><div><br>One week you might be finishing off the redesign of a feature for our creators, the next you might be optimizing a SQL query to keep our storefronts running smoothly. We plan about three months in advance, but we pivot rapidly so you shouldn't expect those plans to be set in stone.</div><div><br>Every developer on the team works on:</div><ul><li>Shipping new features to help our creators' businesses thrive</li><li>Polishing our existing features to improve our users' experience</li><li>Writing tests and fixing bugs in our code</li><li>Communicating their progress in weekly updates</li><li>Reviewing pull requests from other team members</li><li>Helping out our support team with customer issues during a regular week-long rotation</li><li>Paying down technical debt to keep the codebase shiny</li><li>Deploying code to production, verifying it works as you expected, and taking a 24-hour on-call shift for when the worst happens (rarely! 🤞)</li></ul><div>You can expect to be working with:</div><ul><li>Ruby on Rails 6.1</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Stimulus, StimulusReflex, CableReady, Turbo, and React (in that order of most to least often used)</li><li>Webpacker, Bootstrap, ViewComponent, ES6, and yarn to manage our UI code.</li><li>Sidekiq for background processing, including fun features like periodic jobs and batches</li><li>Heroku for everything</li><li>We also maintain integrations with many third-party APIs (PayPal, Stripe, Zapier and Drip, just to name a few)</li><li>A codebase with 1:1.3 code-to-test ratio, with over 10K examples, that runs on our CI system in about four minutes</li></ul><div>You probably don’t know all these technologies inside out, and that’s okay! This is not a laundry list of requirements.</div><div><br>If you’re curious, you can read about <a href=\"https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2020/07/17/podia-engineering-culture/\">Podia’s engineering culture</a> and <a href=\"https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2021/01/01/tools-of-podia-2020-edition/\">our current toolbox</a> on our CTO's blog.<br><br>If you’re the developer we’re looking for, you’ll be seen as a competent developer by your peers, able to quickly iterate on ideas and often called in for your expert opinion. You’ll still be deepening your technical knowledge in many areas but you'll have a core competency in Rails or frontend web development.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You will be based in <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc\">UTC+1</a> to <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc-8\">UTC-8</a> timezones to ensure a reasonable overlap with our current product team in Europe, the US, and Canada.</div><div><br>\"Full-stack\" is an over-used term so let’s put it this way: Rails is our home turf and you'll feel comfortable and productive writing Ruby, building new features in Rails, writing views in ERB, and using ActiveRecord. In addition, you'll probably have a few special areas of expertise or interest. Perhaps you enjoy playing with AWS infrastructure and using Terraform; perhaps you enjoy refactoring and using design patterns to make cleaner software; or you have a flair for user experience design and an eye for detail.</div><div><br>Here are some skill gaps we currently have which we'd like to fill in the short-term:</div><ul><li><strong>Modern JavaScript knowledge.</strong> Do you enjoy tweaking Webpack configuration (or replacing it entirely), reducing Javascript dependencies, and optimizing build pipelines? We prefer Rails and don't write much JavaScript but, when we do, we want it to be modern, efficient, and easy to maintain.</li><li><strong>Frontend CSS expert.</strong> Do you see a design and instantly understand which CSS attributes are required? Can you tweak Bootstrap variables to match our brand? We have a world-class designer, our own UI library, and hundreds of ViewComponents. We need someone who can use these to deliver the best user experiences for our creators.</li></ul><div>These are not definitive so don't exclude yourself if you don't fit one of these descriptions. We have many more needs and we'll find roles for any exceptional candidate.</div><div><strong><br>Some other things you should be comfortable with:</strong></div><ul><li>Communicating your progress clearly in Slack or Basecamp and highlighting blockers and risks early. Communication is a core competency ✍️</li><li>Collaborate with other team members either synchronously during an online pairing session (you can initially expect to be pairing for at least half your time) or asynchronously via pull requests 🍐</li><li>Working individually on solo projects without disappearing down a rabbit hole for days 🕳</li><li>Learning quickly, and developing confidently—because nothing is “someone else’s job” and there's always something new to learn 🦝</li><li>Lending a hand to your teammates (and customers) when the need arises. We’re tightly knit and supporting each other is a huge priority 🤝</li><li>Multiple competing (and sometimes shifting) priorities 😅</li><li>Staying calm under pressure. You remain cool even when Rollbar errors are pouring into Slack, background jobs clog up the Sidekiq queue, and the app grinds to a halt 🆘</li><li>Working remotely. Our team is spread across North America, South America, and Western Europe, and our headquarters is Slack 🌎</li></ul><div><strong>Why work at Podia?</strong></div><ul><li>Ultimate flexibility. We try to have some overlap time every day, but outside of that work whenever &amp; wherever you work best 🗺️</li><li>Extreme autonomy. No micro-managing here. You’ll be given high-level direction and then left to solve it the way you feel is best. 📚</li><li>That said, the rest of the team is always ready to lend a hand—or even an ear if you just need to rubber duck some ideas 💡</li><li>You get to work with a small, highly-talented team that has built—and continues to build—our product with care. We’re not one of those “hire all the devs!” organizations that tries to grow too quickly 🎨</li><li>Whether it’s fixes, small tweaks, or substantial features, we deploy often. There’s zero red tape to slow you down 🚀</li><li>You’ll be working with a diverse team from a range of countries and backgrounds. We work hard to make Podia an inclusive workplace for everyone 🌈</li><li>We have a rapidly growing base of passionate customers. Your work will be seen and appreciated by many people ❤️</li><li>Competitive compensation. We want to hire the best people, and we’re ready to pay for them. We use a standardized salary scale set at the 90th percentile of US salaries for each role—regardless of where you are in the world 💰</li><li>Great benefits including three weeks paid vacation (plus another week during the December holidays), sabbaticals every three years, professional development credit, paid family leave, a new laptop every three years, and more ☺️</li><li>(Paid for) annual retreats to spend time with the team and have fun together (or a still-pretty-great virtual retreat when there’s a global pandemic) ✈️</li></ul><div><strong>About the hiring process<br></strong><br></div><div>Interested in joining our team? Great!&nbsp;</div><div><br>Here's how the process will work: this is an open call so we will evaluate applications as they arrive and there's no closing date. We heavily weigh the answers to our application form rather than data from LinkedIn or resumes. We'll let you know within a few days of receiving your application whether you'll be proceeding to the project phase.</div><div><br>The project phase is a short do-at-home project (paid), run very much like a Podia development project with a GitHub repo, issues to resolve, and code delivered as pull requests. We typically allow a week for the completion of the project but expect you’ll only need about four hours.</div><div><br>We review the test projects and determine if the candidate will go on for an interview (typically takes us a few days). Candidates will have two technical interviews, one with our CTO and another with a senior developer lasting about 30-45 minutes each. There's no whiteboarding, stupid brain teasers, or algorithms to implement—just two people having a chat over Zoom about your experiences and approach to work.</div><div><br>The last interview will be with Spencer, our CEO, who can answer any questions you have about the broader goals and workings of the company.</div><div><br>After that, we'll decide on our final candidates and ask for professional references from both a previous co-worker and a manager. We'll reach out to those references to set up a brief 10-minute call.</div><div><br>Finally, all going well, we'll make a written offer to the successful candidate which can be signed electronically 🥳</div><div><br>We’re looking forward to chatting 🙂</div>",

Once familiar with the project, we expect engineers to be able to take ownership and guide large projects from start to finish. We write down ideas and work as asynchronously as possible, meeting via video conference when necessary. Proposing ideas and trying things matter more than always being right. We are frequently wrong and try to write code we can easily change when we learn new things. We’re excited for you to participate and look forward to helping you grow your own skills as well.<br><br></div><div><strong>Diversity</strong><br>Given that we’re writing software for the globe, it’s critical that our team represent the diverse environments in which we operate.

You will be expected to build and execute a product roadmap that achieves a strategic vision. The product manager is the decision-maker, the person who can take a variety of inputs and skillfully decide what actions must take place immediately, next, and never.</li><li>Research and spec out how things should work. Explain the obvious. Engineering shouldn’t have to ask a million questions when they start working on a feature.</li><li>Organize feedback, bugs, and ideas into a development backlog. You’ll use tools like Balsamiq or Figma to prototype creative solutions and work with designers and developers to refine and implement them.</li><li>Communicate internally and externally.
